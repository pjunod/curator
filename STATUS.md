## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton ✅ (shipped 2026-07-17)

- [x] Repo scaffold per blueprint §12 + GPL-3.0 license
- [x] Go module (`github.com/monarr-media/monarr`) + Makefile build orchestration
- [x] Single static binary serving the embedded React shell (go:embed, SPA fallback page)
- [x] Spec-first `/api/v1` (OpenAPI 3 + oapi-codegen): `system/status`, `health`, `system/tasks`, `tasks/{name}/run`
- [x] SQLite via modernc: WAL mode, single-writer discipline, read pool
- [x] goose migrations embedded in the binary (up-only policy)
- [x] sqlc compile-time-checked queries (app_meta, scheduled_tasks)
- [x] Config: env > optional JSON file > defaults (port 7676, data dir, log level/format)
- [x] Structured logging via log/slog (text/json)
- [x] Typed in-process event bus (non-blocking fan-out, typed subscribe)
- [x] Scheduler: jittered intervals, manual trigger, panic recovery, state persisted across restarts
- [x] Health-check registry (database, data-directory, web-ui) publishing transitions on the bus
- [x] SSE event stream `/api/v1/events` (bus → UI live)
- [x] React + TS + Vite shell: Dashboard + System pages, live event feed, dark theme
- [x] Dockerfile: multi-stage, distroless, `/data` volume, port 7676
- [x] ADRs 0001–0006 + full architecture blueprint in `docs/`
- [x] Architecture dependency-arrows enforced by test (`internal/arch_test.go`)

## Phase 0.5 — Tests, hooks, CI ✅ (shipped 2026-07-17)

- [x] Go unit tests across all infra/app packages (run with `-race` in CI)
- [x] Web unit tests (vitest) for the UI API/formatting helpers
- [x] E2E suite: Playwright boots the real compiled binary, 7 specs incl. bus→SSE→browser round-trip
- [x] Git hooks in `.githooks/` (`make hooks`): pre-commit fmt/vet/typecheck, pre-push unit suites, graceful skip when a toolchain is missing
- [x] golangci-lint v2 pinned (`make lint`), zero findings
- [x] CI: 4 parallel jobs (unit + coverage summary + gen-drift check, lint, e2e, docker), least-privilege permissions, per-ref cancellation
- [x] STATUS.md as the explicit work ledger (this file)

## Phase 1 — Library ✅ (shipped 2026-07-17)

- [x] Migration 0002: `media_items` with `kind` CHECK (`movie|series|book` — book reserved per ADR 0006), external ids incl. isbn/olid/asin
- [x] `seasons` + `episodes` child tables
- [x] `media_files` + n:m file↔episode link table (ADR 0002)
- [x] `root_folders` + `settings` tables (TMDB API key lives in the DB, managed in UI)
- [x] `MetadataProvider` port (search + hydrate) — first port with a real consumer
- [x] TMDB adapter: auth, rate limiting, response caching
- [x] Add-movie flow: search TMDB → add → metadata hydrated
- [x] Add-series flow with full season/episode hydration
- [x] Library list/detail API endpoints
- [x] Library browse UI (posters, list, detail)
- [x] Root-folder management (API + UI)
- [x] Disk scan: walk root folders, parse on-disk files
- [x] Reconcile: diff disk vs DB, repair links, flag TMDB-ordering disagreements for manual review

## Phase 2 — Acquisition core ✅ (shipped 2026-07-17)

- [x] Release-name parser v1 (pure function, table-driven)
- [x] Golden corpus harness over `testdata/releases/` at 100% conformance (54 cases hand-seeded from upstream naming patterns; literal Sonarr/Radarr suite port remains an easy extension)
- [x] Parser fuzzing (must never panic on arbitrary bytes)
- [x] Wantable implementations (movie, episode, season) — season-pack fan-out modeled
- [x] `SearchPlanner` + `ReleaseMatcher` per media kind
- [x] Matcher: title normalization, year tolerance, season/episode + pack coverage
- [x] Decision engine v1 with machine-readable rejection reasons
- [x] Quality model + profiles (ordered groups, cutoff, upgrades)
- [x] Torznab/Newznab indexer adapter (search + caps test, one adapter for both; RSS lands with Phase 3)
- [x] Indexer management (API + UI)
- [x] Interactive search UI with rejection reasons attached
- [x] qBittorrent download-client adapter
- [x] SABnzbd download-client adapter
- [x] Queue tracker: client polling reconciled to the Download state machine
- [x] Importer: scan payload, map files→Wantables, per-file decisions
- [x] Renamer with Sonarr/Radarr-compatible tokens; hardlink-or-copy import

## Phase 2.5 — Books (ADR 0006) ✅ (shipped 2026-07-18)

- [x] Metadata bake-off → **Open Library** (open data, no key, work-level ids, covers; Google Books rate-limits anonymous callers, Hardcover needs an account) — `BookProvider` port + adapter, fixture contract-tested
- [x] Book external IDs end-to-end (isbn13 from editions, work OLID, asin column reserved) — unique `(kind, olid)`
- [x] Book-mode parser rules + golden corpus (12 cases seeded from Readarr/scene naming patterns; literal Readarr suite port remains an easy extension) — author extraction, order-swap tolerant matching
- [x] Book `SearchPlanner`/`ReleaseMatcher` (author+title queries; Torznab 7000/7020 + 3030)
- [x] Format quality ladder: PDF<MOBI<AZW3<EPUB + MP3<M4B; seeded **Ebook** (id 4) and **Audiobook** (id 5) profiles; books default to Ebook
- [x] `{Author Name}/{Book Title}` naming, Calibre-friendly (`Title - Author.ext`); import + scan grade book files by extension
- [x] Add/browse books in the UI (Book tab in Add, Books library filter, author on detail, release search + grab) — e2e: search → add → grab EPUB → auto-import, M4B rejected by profile

## Phase 3 — Automation ✅ (shipped 2026-07-18)

- [x] Wanted index (in-memory, invalidated on add/scan/import/delete events, lazily rebuilt; in-flight downloads and pack-covered episodes excluded) — `GET /wanted`
- [x] RSS sync loop per indexer (15 min, jittered): fetch → parse → match wanted → decide → auto-grab
- [x] Backlog search (12 h + manual): planned queries per wantable, best accepted release grabbed, 20/run cap
- [x] Failed-download handling: blocklist (unique release+indexer, `GET/DELETE /blocklist`) + automatic re-search on client failure or import error
- [x] Calendar (API + UI): airing episodes + movie/book release dates, agenda view with -7/+30 day paging
- [x] Webhook notifier (stable lowercase JSON wire format)
- [x] Discord notifier (embeds via webhook URL)
- [x] Plex/Jellyfin library-refresh notifiers (poked on imports only, never chatter)
- [x] Scheduled SQLite online backups: daily `VACUUM INTO`, last 7 kept, listed on the System page — e2e proves the whole circle: delete file → rescan → wanted → RSS re-grab → re-import → webhook notified

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem compat

- [ ] `/sonarr/api/v3` personality (scoped to what Jellyseerr/Prowlarr/Bazarr call — §6)
- [ ] `/radarr/api/v3` personality
- [ ] X-Api-Key auth, case-insensitive routes, plausible upstream version strings
- [ ] Unknown-v3-request logging to guide shim expansion
- [ ] Conformance harness: docker-compose vs real Jellyseerr + Prowlarr + Bazarr
- [ ] (stretch) one-shot *arr DB importer

## Phase 5 — Depth & parity tail

- [ ] Custom-format scoring engine
- [ ] More download clients (Transmission, Deluge, NZBGet, …)
- [ ] Import lists (Trakt/TMDB)
- [ ] Anime absolute numbering (TVDB/AniDB mapping tables)
- [ ] Auth hardening: API key + session login for UI
- [ ] Mass editor + richer season views
- [ ] Optional Prometheus `/metrics`

## Launch logistics

- [x] `monarr-media` GitHub org (free) + private repo + initial push
- [x] Container registry decision: ghcr.io (no Docker Hub subscription — ADR 0001 amendment)
- [ ] File dormant-username request with GitHub Support for `monarr`
- [ ] Register a domain
- [ ] Flip repo public + branch ruleset requiring the four CI checks
- [ ] goreleaser: tagged releases with binaries + ghcr.io images (target: end of Phase 1)

## Decisions to date

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| [0001](docs/adr/0001-name-and-license.md) | Name **Monarr**, **GPL-3.0**, port **7676**; amended: org/module `monarr-media`, images on ghcr.io |
| [0002](docs/adr/0002-single-media-table.md) | One `media_items` table + `kind`; files↔episodes n:m; Wantable abstraction |
| [0003](docs/adr/0003-compat-personalities.md) | v3 compat as `/sonarr` + `/radarr` URL-base personalities, translation-only |
| [0004](docs/adr/0004-sqlite-only.md) | SQLite only (modernc, WAL, single writer); no Postgres |
| [0005](docs/adr/0005-filesystem-adoption.md) | Migration by filesystem adoption; *arr DB import is a stretch item |
| [0006](docs/adr/0006-books-third-media-kind.md) | Books as a third kind — ebooks + audiobooks, Phase 2.5 |
